<p>Bootstrap is modular and consists of a series of Less (or Sass in version 4 and onward) stylesheets that implement the various components of the toolkit. These stylesheets are generally compiled into a bundle and included in web pages, but individual components can be included or removed. Bootstrap provides a number of configuration variables that control things such as color and padding of various components.Since Bootstrap 2, the Bootstrap documentation has included a customization wizard which generates a customized version of Bootstrap based on the requested components and various settings.</p>
<p>As of Bootstrap 4, Sass is used instead of Less for the stylesheets.Each Bootstrap component consists of an HTML structure, CSS declarations, and in some cases accompanying JavaScript code.Grid system and responsive design comes standard with an 1170-pixel-wide grid layout. Alternatively, the developer can use a variable-width layout. For both cases, the toolkit has four variations to make use of different resolutions and types of devices: mobile phones, portrait and landscape, tablets and PCs with low and high resolution. Each variation adjusts the width of the columns.</p>
